        SpaceWork enables civilians to take a 36-hour trip through our solar system, making viewing stops above the atmospheres of Jupiter and Venus and a short stop on the moon. Our craft Zeus 11 hosts a variety of passenger cabins including one, two, and four person options, as well as luxurious common spaces and a fully-equipped kitchen and restaurant. Travellers will enjoy 360 degree views from our state-of-the-art observatory, where professional cameras and telescopes are available for use. Before returning to Earth, guests will be trained as astronauts and take a short moonwalk on the surface of Earth’s moon.
