      We have partnered with teams at the National Space Agency to ensure safe launch and recovery of the Zeus 11 vehicle. Crews will be on site at the time of launch, landing, and recovery. The vehicle will perform a marine landing to prevent damage on impact approximately 5 miles off the coast of Cape Canaveral. Six rescue and recovery teams will be on-site at the time of landing, and Zeus 11’s innovative flotation devices will ensure a smooth and safe landing experience. After exiting the spacecraft, passengers will be escorted by boat to the Cape Canaveral launchpad, where complimentary rooms will be provided for 48 hours after launch to provide passengers a comfortable place to decompress and re-accustom themselves to Earth’s atmosphere.
